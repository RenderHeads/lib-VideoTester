# Video Sanity Testing Tool

This project is intended to allow our internal and external team members to quickly check if a video file matches a specific configuration that we need, to ensure the video will work in the game / application it has been made for. The intention is to catch problems with video files early on in the process and prevent slow downs later on in the development process.

## Principle Design:
FFProbe can provided us with meta data in a format that is pretty easy to parse. Given the complicated nature of the syntax, this project acts as a wrapper tool that generally simplifies things for the non power-user.

For example the following ffprobe command:
```
ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=width,height,duration,bit_rate,r_frame_rate,codec_name -of default=noprint_wrappers=1 myvideo.mov
```

will return an output as follows:
```
codec_name=h264
width=3840
height=2160
r_frame_rate=25/1
duration=13.800000
bit_rate=23204268
```

This is pretty easy to then parse and compare against some known configuration. This project provides an API to get these details, as well as compare them against configurations. It also has a CLI tool  and simple GUI that implements the API.

Configurations are specified in json format in a ```Configurations``` folder.

Below is an example configuration file - These files need to be valid JSON
```
{
  "Name": "Transparent Videos"
  "ValidCodecs": [ "hap" ],
  "MaxWidth": 2048,
  "MaxHeight": 1024,
  "FrameRates": [ 30, 60 ],
  "MaxBitRate": 1024
}
```
- Name: A friendly name to give the configuration for display purposes.
- ValidCodec: an array of codec names that are valid
- MaxWidth: the largest the video width can be.
- MaxHeight: the largest the video height can be.
- FrameRates: An array of integer values for acceptable frame rates.
- Max Bitrate:  The highest acceptable bitrate in KBPS.


# Dependencies
This project requires *ffprobe* (part of ffmpeg package) installed on your computer and available in PATH. We may make a version that distributes this together with the build.

## Installing FFProbe
- Mac (CLI): Run `./download-ffprobe` from the repo's root directory. If you want a system install of *ffprobe* run `brew install ffprobe`.
- Windows: Download here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html - install and add to path manually.
- Ubuntu(CLI): ```sudo apt install ffmpeg```

# Build Requirements
- dotNet 6.
- dotNet MAUI (to build the cross platform GUI).
- We use the Visual Studio IDE, but any will do.


# Example Command Line Usage

```
./VideoTesterConsoleApp -i YOUR_FILE_HERE.EXTENSION
```

The below screenshot shows an example of the commandline application indicating that the video file does not match an acceptable configuration.

# Known Issues:
~~HAP Codec files width and height, need to be divisible by 4, however the logic to check if we have HAP codec specified, is currently flawed as it doesn't account for all the different flavours of HAP~~.
Configuration will not pass if video is set to hap and not divisible by 4. While this is the correct behaviour, it does not show this to the user and will seem like a bug.


# Low hanging fruit
Some things that would be easy to PR in, if someone was up to it
-  ~~Upgrade  CLI and test project from dotnet Core 3.1 to 6.~~
-  ~~Handle corrupted Json files~~ (Will ignore corrupted json files).
- ~~Neaten up files locations and interfaces~~
- ~~Separate out logic for parsing FFMPEG meta data~~
- ~~Start documenting library API before it gets out of hand~~
- ~~Read config from json~~ (it will try parse all JSON files in the Configurations directory).
- ~~Rename the folder for the Console project (it is badly named).~~
- ~~Better argument handling.~~  (Using System.Commandline dotNet preview package by microsoft)
- ~~Add Name  field in configuration.~~

# Version 1 MVP Requirements (can do in any order):
- Add linting rules and clean up formatting
- Add a CI pipeline to Auto Build.
- Add sentry logging to CLI + app for error logging (Be sure to setup sensible Contexts)
- Bundle ffprobe in release so we don't have to rely on PATH
- Make sure GUI tool works on windows and mac (currently will probably only work on mac)
- ~~Make sure we can handle the "divisble by 4" check for HAP videos in a way that the user understands.~~

# Limitations
- We only check the first stream of the video file.
- We don't get audio data and check that

# GUI Tool

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18391483/218274746-9e62e599-563f-412d-8bda-45884b366450.mov

There is a GUI tool contained in the VideoTesterApp Project.  This uses dotNet MAUI and in principle can build cross platform, however it will likely only work on mac until we make it work on Windows. 


# Api
The Api can be found in **SRC/LibVideoTester/Api/Api.cs**

Usage 1) The One Liner
```
Dictionary<string, Configuration> results = await VideoTesterApi.ExtractMetaDataAndFindConfigMatchesAsync("/movie.mov");
if (results.Keys.Count > 0){
  //you have a configuration that matches!!
}
```
Usage 2) Do it in steps for more control
```
//1) Get our video meta data
VideoMetaData data = await VideoTesterApi.GetVideoMetaDataAsync("/movie.mov");          

//2) Read our configurations from directory
Dictionary<string, Configuration> configuration = await VideoTesterApi.GetConfigurationsAsync();

//3) Check for matches
Dictionary<string, Configuration> results = VideoTesterApi.FindMatches(data, configuration);
```

Usage 3) Advanced (changing default behaviour)
```
//This will override default behaviour and instead of reading from FFProbe, it will just use some dummy data, as per our tests
VideoMetaData data = await VideoTesterApi.GetVideoMetaDataAsync("/movie.mov",new DummyMetaDataGenerator());      

//In this contrived example we will fetch configs from AWS S3 instead of disk, and replace our json deserializer with a Yaml deserializer
Dictionary<string, Configuration> configuration = VideoTesterApi.GetConfigurationsAsync("Configurations", new S3FileProvider(), new YamlDeserializer<Configuration>())


```

# Development

## Version Control
Trunk based development is used in this project, and as such, PRs will be squashed and rebased onto `main` when merged.

## Setup
### Code Styling
We use `astyle` to format the code correctly. You can install `astyle` by following [these instructions](https://astyle.sourceforge.net/install.html).

Then add a file watcher to your favourite IDE to automatically format your `.cs` files when you save them.

*TODO*: Styling and linting will be added as pre-commit hooks and to the CI.

To format a file:
```bash
astyle -n <FILE>
```
To format all C# files in the repo:
```
find . -iname "*.cs" -not -path "*/obj/*" -not -path "*.xaml.cs" | xargs astyle -n
```
