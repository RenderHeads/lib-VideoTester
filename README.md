# Video Sanity Testing Tool
This project is being built to allow our internal and external team members to  quickly check if a video file matches a specific configuration that we need, to ensure the video will work in the game / application it has been made for. The intention is to catch problems with files early on in the process and prevent slow downs later on in the development process.

# Dependencies
This project requries *ffprobe* (part of ffmpeg package) installed on your compmuter and available in PATH. We  will probably  want to build this in at some point.

# Project Structure
The project is made up out of a console app, a tests project and a library.

# Things it can check
- Width, Height, Codec, Bit rate, Frame Rate

# Example Usage
Currently it is just configured to allow h264 files to pass.  In the demo below, the first video passes, the second video fails.

# Low hanging fruit
Some things that would be easy to PR in, if someone was up to it
- Setup linting rules.
- ~~Read config from json~~ (it will try parse all JSON files in the Configurations directory).
- ~~Rename the folder for the Console project (it is badly named).~~
- Better argument handling.
- Add a CI pipeline to Auto Build.
- Add a built in version of ffprobe to prevent need of  pre installed dependecy
- Get Audio Streams and Channels, and add appropriate configuration.
- Add an option to generate a report and save it next to the checked file.

# Limitations
- We only check the first stream of the video file.

# Next Steps
- Clean up formatting, add linting rules
- Add CI Pipeline to auto build
- Add in library for better command line argument handling
- Add check for ffprobe on path and if it can't find it print an error
- Add flag to save report to file
- Build little GUI with dotNet MAUI
  - Make path to ffprobe configurable?
